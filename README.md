On its website, SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars. In contrast,
other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars for each launch. One of the reasons for the
significant cost difference is that SpaceX can reuse the first stage of the rocket. Therefore, if we can
accurately predict whether the first stage will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a
launch.
We will use public information to predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage (Booster) by
training five different machine learning models and evaluating them using information from various
sources about SpaceX.
In order to determine the price of each SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch, we will assess the likelihood
of a successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage.
